# Duplicate Character Remover


This is a web application built using ReactJS that allows users to remove all duplicate characters from a string. It consists of two screens. On the first screen, the user is required to input a string and submit it. On the second screen, the application renders each character of the string as a card with a delete icon on hover. Clicking on the delete icon will remove all duplicate instances of the chosen character in the string.

## Installation

## Usage

1. Input a non-empty value in the input field on   Screen 1 and click the 'Submit' button to proceed to Screen 2. If the input field is empty or has only space characters, an alert will be displayed, requesting the user to provide a non-empty value.

2.On Screen 2, each character of the input string is rendered as a card with a delete icon on top on hover. Clicking on the character removes all other instances of the chosen character in the string and updates the cards on the screen with a success message.

3.Cards with the same characters have the same background color.

4.If there are no more characters with more than one appearance in the string, a success header is displayed, showing the original string and the new resultant string.

5.Click the back button to return to Screen 1. The input field is cleared.


## Technology Used

The app is built with ReactJS and the routing is handled by React Router.
